# Semester Two Notes and Resources

Welcome to the Semester One Notes repository! This repository provides comprehensive notes and resources for students at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, Topi, Swabi-KPK Pakistan. These materials aim to help juniors navigate their academic journey with ease and confidence.

Note: This repository addresses only courses with a higher difficulty level.

## Repository Structure and Instructions

The repository is organized by subjects and topics covered during the second semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources.

### Courses/Subjects

**Mathematics - MT 101**
  - **DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This course should be manageable if you've put in good efforts in college mathematics, especially for Federal Board (FBISE) students, as the content is similar. Since it's a 3 credit hour course, it can significantly affect your grade. Practice daily and use verified solutions for "Advanced Engineering Mathematics" by Erwin Kreyszig and "A First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications" by Dennis G. Zill available on Quizlet.

**Computer Science - CS 112**
  - **Object-Oriented Programming and Design Lab (4 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 
This course includes a 3-credit hour theoretical component and a 1-credit hour lab. By the end of the first semester, your programming skills will have significantly improved, making it easier to grasp new concepts and apply them in your coding activities. While this course is not particularly difficult, it covers a wide range of concepts. Therefore, familiarizing yourself with these concepts before the semester begins can be very beneficial. To get a head start, I recommend watching and learning Object-Oriented Programming in C++ from Safdar Dogar. The link to the related playlist is provided below.
