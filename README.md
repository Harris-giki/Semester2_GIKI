# Semester Two Notes and Resources

Welcome to the Semester Two Notes repository! This repository provides comprehensive notes and resources for students at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, Topi, Swabi-KPK Pakistan. These materials aim to help juniors navigate their academic journey with ease and confidence.

Note: This repository addresses only courses with a higher difficulty level.

## Repository Structure and Instructions

The repository is organized by subjects and topics covered during the second semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources.

### Courses/Subjects

**Mathematics - MT 102**
  - **DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This course should be manageable if you've put in good efforts in college mathematics, especially for Federal Board (FBISE) students, as the content is similar. Since it's a 3 credit hour course, it can significantly affect your grade. Practice daily and use verified solutions for "Advanced Engineering Mathematics" by Erwin Kreyszig and "A First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications" by Dennis G. Zill available on Quizlet.

Note that there are two textbooks for this course, so chapter numbers might overlap. Chapters suffixed with an "E" in the MT102 file names refer to Erwin Kreyszig's book.

**Computer Science - CS 112**
  - **Object-Oriented Programming and Design Lab (4 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 
This course includes a 3-credit hour theoretical component and a 1-credit hour lab. By the end of the first semester, your programming skills will have significantly improved, making it easier to grasp new concepts and apply them in your coding activities. While this course is not particularly difficult, it covers a wide range of concepts. Therefore, familiarizing yourself with these concepts before the semester begins can be very beneficial. To get a head start, I recommend watching and learning Object-Oriented Programming in C++ from Safdar Dogar. The link to the related playlist is provided below.

**Material and Nanotechnology - MM 101**
  - **MATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY (2 Credit Hours)**

Instructions:
This course builds on concepts you may have studied in FSC chemistry, but it approaches them from a more scientific perspective.
Obtain past papers from your TAs and instructors, as many exam and quiz questions are often repeated.
Focus on every lecture slide carefully rather than delving deeply into the textbook.
Pay special attention to numerical problems, as they will constitute a significant portion of your midterm and final exams.

**Material and Nanotechnology LAB - MM 101/MM141**
  - **MATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY LAB (1 Credit Hours)**

Instructions:
Lab sessions are held *weekly for three hours*, with each session covering a different experiment. The content is straightforward and manageable, so there's no need to worry. Midterm and final exams mainly consist of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on lab manuals and lecture slides. Study these materials thoroughly. Midterm exams may also include short questions on point and plane diagrams of various cubic structures.


**Probability and Statistics - ES 111**
  - **PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions:
This 3-credit hour course can significantly impact your grade. A-level students may find the pre-midterm section manageable since much of the content is similar to what they had already studied. In contrast, FSC students will need to dedicate considerable time and effort to grasp the material. Solving numerous related problems is crucial for success. However, the post-midterm portion of the course is relatively easier than the pre-midterm section.
