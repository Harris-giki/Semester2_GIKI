## Repository Structure and Instructions

The repository is organized by **subjects** and **topics** covered during the second semester. Each subject includes:

- **Detailed notes**
- **Example problems**
- **Additional resources**

---

## Courses/Subjects

### Mathematics - MT 102
#### **Differential Equations and Linear Algebra (3 Credit Hours)**

**Instructions:**

This course is manageable if you have a strong background in college mathematics, particularly if you're from the **Federal Board (FBISE)**, as the content aligns with what you've previously studied. Since it's a 3-credit hour course, it can significantly affect your overall grade. 

- **Daily Practice** is key to mastering the concepts.
- Use verified solutions from the following resources:
  - *Advanced Engineering Mathematics* by **Erwin Kreyszig**
  - *A First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications* by **Dennis G. Zill** (available on Quizlet)

**Important Notes**: There are two textbooks for this course, so chapter numbers may overlap. Chapters marked with an "E" in the MT102 file names refer to Kreyszig's book.

---

### Computer Science - CS 112
#### **Object-Oriented Programming and Design Lab (4 Credit Hours)**

**Instructions:**

This course comprises a **3-credit hour theoretical** component and a **1-credit hour lab**. By the end of the first semester, your programming skills should have significantly improved, making the new concepts easier to grasp and apply.

- This course covers a **broad range of concepts** but is not particularly difficult.
- To get a head start, familiarize yourself with **Object-Oriented Programming in C++** before the semester begins. You can follow the **playlist** by **Safdar Dogar** on YouTube for a comprehensive guide.

### Material and Nanotechnology - MM 101
#### **Materials and Nanotechnology (2 Credit Hours)**

**Instructions:**

This course builds upon concepts you might have studied in **FSC Chemistry**, but takes a more scientific approach. To succeed:

- **Past papers** are a great resource, as many exam and quiz questions are often repeated. Reach out to your **TAs** and **instructors** for past papers.
- Focus more on **lecture slides** than the textbook for optimal preparation.
- **Numerical problems** are a major part of midterm and final exams, so make sure to practice them thoroughly.

---

### Material and Nanotechnology LAB - MM 101/MM141
#### **Materials and Nanotechnology Lab (1 Credit Hour)**

**Instructions:**

- **Lab sessions** are held weekly for 3 hours, with each session dedicated to a different experiment.
- The content is **manageable**, so don’t stress.
- Midterm and final exams will primarily consist of **multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** based on **lab manuals** and **lecture slides**. Be sure to study these thoroughly.
- Midterms may include **short questions** related to **point and plane diagrams** of cubic structures.

---

### Probability and Statistics - ES 111
#### **Probability and Statistics (3 Credit Hours)**

**Instructions:**

This 3-credit hour course plays an important role in your final grade.

- **A-Level** students may find the **pre-midterm section** easier, as it’s similar to what they've already studied.
- **FSC** students, on the other hand, will need to invest more time and effort to understand the material.
- Success in this course requires **solving related problems** regularly.
- The **post-midterm** portion of the course is generally **easier** than the pre-midterm section.
